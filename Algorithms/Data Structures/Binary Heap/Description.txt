Heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property:
If A is a parent node of B then key(A) is ordered with respect to key(B) with 
the same ordering applying across the heap. 

The operations commonly performed with a heap are:
1. create-heap: create an empty heap
2. heapify: create a heap out of given array of elements
3. find-max or find-min: find the maximum item of a max-heap or a minimum item of a min-heap, respectively (aka, peek)
4. delete-max or delete-min: removing the root node of a max- or min-heap, respectively
4. increase-key or decrease-key: updating a key within a max- or min-heap, respectively
5. insert: adding a new key to the heap
6. merge: joining two heaps to form a valid new heap containing all the elements of both.

Complexity (min-heap):

find-min		Θ(1)
delete-min		Θ(log n)
insert			Θ(log n)
decrease-key	Θ(log n)
merge			Θ(n)

Binary Heap is a heap where each node have at most two children.
